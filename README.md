# Translating-a-language-BPL-to-assembly-language

The objective of this project is to take input code written in BPL and produce a corresponding assembly code.
Collaboratively completed with two colleagues, Luís Míguel and Nelsi Sousa, this project was undertaken as part of our college coursework.
The task was conducted within the scope of the Software Basics course at the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil, as a component of the Computer Science program.
The term "BPL" refers to the Bruno Programming Language, an language devised by our professor. 
A detailed explanation of BPL can be found in the document titled "description.pdf," presented in Portuguese.
